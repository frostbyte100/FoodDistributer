#Food Dealer

Think back on the last time you threw away perfectly good food, perhaps remains from a large meal at a restaurant or food which you won't be able to eat before they go bad.
In the USA, about 20 lbs of food per person is wasted each month. That is over 30% of the food supply! Yet, there are plenty of people who struggle to eat well, such as students and the homeless.

This is where Food Dealer comes in. Food Dealer lets peolple with an oversupply of food post a time and place for the hungry to pick up. Meanwhile, hungry people in need can browse through postings and photos of free meals nearby.
